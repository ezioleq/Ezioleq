## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a self-taught programmer from Poland who mostly fiddle with **C#**, **C++** and **C**. I'm currently working as a Junior C# Developer, especially working with mobile applications for Android and iOS. I like to learn new things and have fun while learning them. In the future I'd like to spend more time on so called game programming as it's something that excites me.
